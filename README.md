# csci437-low-level-game
A basic game engine built from ground up

Requires python3 and pygame. Run the example game by typing the following command:

    python3 game.py


### Assignment Specifications:

Build a game in Python, Java, C++, or any other general-purpose language WITHOUT using a high-level game engine.

For this exercise, the language does not matter, but you will need to build a basic working 2D game that illustrates your ability to implement the following concepts without a game engine:

* Game Loop with a specified frame rate
* 2D surface for game play
* A refresh / update mechanism
* Some type of sprite entity (class or struct preferred)
* Collision-detection
* Boundary management
* Transformation - translation, rotation, and scaling

You may build a game or you can build an engine with a a simple demo on top, as long as you illustrate the ideas.

### Implementation

A basic game engine, written in python 3, written on top of pygame:

    Use the documentation in the game.py file to understand how to use this python3 game engine
